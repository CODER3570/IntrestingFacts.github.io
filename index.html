      <h1>Intresting Facts </h1>
      <li>
        <h3>More than 52% of the world's population is under 30 years old.</h3>
      </li>
      <p>According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), as of 2012, 50.5 percent of the world's population were people under the age of 30. Around 89.7% of those young people live in emerging and
        developing economies like the Middle East and Africa</p>

        <h3>The best place in the world to see rainbows is in Hawaii</h3>
      </li>
      <p>If you're an avid rainbow gazer and want to get your fill of the beautiful phenomenon, look no further than the state of Hawaii. A study published by the American Meteorological Society in 2021 noted that the area's "mountains produce sharp
        gradients in clouds and rainfall, which are key to abundant rainbow sightings." Air pollution, pollen, and a large amount of cresting waves also help to put Hawaii at the top of the list when it comes to rainbow quantity and quality</p>

        <h3>The coldest temperature ever recorded was -144 degrees Fahrenheit.</h3>
      </li>
      <p>You might think you're accustomed to frigid air and blustery winds, but the average winter day has nothing on the coldest day ever recorded, which was -144 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature was recorded in Antarctica during a span of
        research between 2004 and 2016. Just a few breaths of air at that temperature would induce hemorrhaging in your lungs and kill you.</p>
      <li class="four">
        <h3>Four babies are born every second.</h3>
        <p>Every second, we welcome four new babies into our overall population. Do a little math and you'll find out that means there are approximately 250 births each minute, 15,000 each hour, and 360,000 each day.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="five">
        <h3>The entire world's population could fit inside Los Angeles.</h3>
        <p>The world's total population is more than 7.5 billion. And obviously, that number sounds huge. However, it might feel a little more manageable once you learn that if every single one of those people stood shoulder-to-shoulder, they could
          all fit within the 500 square miles of Los Angeles, according to National Geographic.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="six">
        <h3>The fastest gust of wind ever recorded on Earth was 253 miles per hour.</h3>
        <p>Hang on to your hats because this isn't your average wind storm. In 1996, a tropical cyclone named Olivia hit off the coast of Barrow Island, Australia with such a force that it broke an incredible record. According to The Weather Channel,
          "Olivia's eyewall produced five extreme three-second wind gusts, the peak of which was a 253 mph gust," which blew past the previous wind record of 231 mph set in Mount Washington, New Hampshire back in 1934.</p>

        <h3>The Earth's ozone layer will make a full recovery in 50 years.</h3>
        <p>Because of pollution, the Earth's ozone layer has suffered a lot. That's bad news for everyone, since the fragile gas layer protects our planet and shields us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Fortunately, climate change experts
          believe that the ozone layer will fully heal within 50 years, according to a 2018 report from the United Nations.

          The recovery is thanks in large part to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which put a global ban on the use of one of the main culprits for the damage: chlorofluorocarbons (CFOs). Previously, CFOs had been common in refrigerators, aerosol
          cans, and dry-cleaning chemicals.</p>

        <h3>Climate change is causing flowers to change color.</h3>
        <p>Don't worry, your prized red roses aren't going to turn turquoise overnight, but an increase in UV radiation due to the ozone layer deteriorating over the past decades has caused flowers all over the globe to change. A 2020 study led by
          Clemson University scientists determined that the UV pigmentation in flowers has increased over time which has led to the degradation of their pollen. Although we can't see the color change with our eyes, it is a big problem for pollinators
          like bees who are attracted to the bright colors that flowers produce.</p>

      <li class="nine">
        <h3>There are around 4 quadrillion quadrillion bacteria on Earth.</h3>
        <p>Not all bacteria are bad. In fact, some of those itty-bitty biological cells are actually good for us and aide the world in various and complex ways. And that's nice to know, considering there are around 4 quadrillion quadrillion
          individual bacteria on our planet, according to NPR.</p>

        <h3>Recent droughts in Europe were the worst in 2,100 years.</h3>
        <p>Europe has been experiencing serious dry spells and extreme heat since 2015, which has caused major droughts. Research done led by the University of Cambridge (and published on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website)
          looked at isotopes in the rings of old European Oak trees in Central Europe which formed over thousands of years to try to pin down the cause. They discovered that the dry spells are a "result of human-caused climate change and associated
          shifts in the jet stream," according to EurekAlert!</p>

        <h3>More people speak Mandarin Chinese than any other language.</h3>
        <p>With around 950 million native speakers and an additional 200 million people speaking Mandarin Chinese as a second language, it's the most widely spoken language in the world.</p>
